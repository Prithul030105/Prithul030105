Question:In this problem an array [a] is given of consecutive numbers
AIM: If one element is missing in the array we are to find that one element 
Conditions: We are not allowed to use Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/division
For each number we can use: Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal and binary numbers
Solution: First we are to convert each element of the array in its binary form; Then we have to create an algorithm to the LSB of the numbers.
Consecutive numbers in their binary form have the LSB in the order of 0 and 1
if two consecutive zeroes or two consecutive ones comes, then we can say that on element is missing between them.
Thus we created an algorithm that can predict the missing number.

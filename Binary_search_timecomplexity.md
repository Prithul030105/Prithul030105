In this problem Binary search operations are being performed on arrays of different sizes and measures how long each search takes.
It helps us understand how the efficiency of Binary search changes as the size of the data increases, which is why the output shows larger times for larger arrays.
A graph is then being plotted for the average case,worst case and the best case for the Binary search.
Time Complexity of various operations like Searching, Insertion, Deletion, Clearance, Sorting, Update is being calculated.

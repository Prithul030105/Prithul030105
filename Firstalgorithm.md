This the first algorithm which contains:
AIM: A list of n given numbers is there, We are to print a combination of A,B,C such that A+B=C (A,B,C are the elements of the list)
How it works: (ALGORITHM)
First we need to enter a number n from the user(n=number of elements present in the list)
Then we will run a for loop to input the elements of the list one by one
After that to find the combination of these Three numbers we will run 3 nested looops

The first loop will run from 1 to n 
another nested loops under this loop will run from i+1 to n
and one another nested loop will run under this loop starting from 1 to n
Under this loop we will enter our equation i.e. a[i]+a[j]==a[k]
and we will give the print command after that


SO whenever such combination will be found by the algorithm , the algorithm will print those combination of 3 numbers.


OUTPUT:

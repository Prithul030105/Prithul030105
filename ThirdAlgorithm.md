Ques: A ball Is thrown from a certain height with some velocity. After one bounce the velocity is reduced by half
AIM: To find after how many bounces the velocity of the ball will be zero?
Solution: In this question we will use a WHILE loop and initiate the count. 
Every time the ball bounces the count will get incremented by 1 using count++ and the new_velocity=old_velocity/2
In this way when the velocity will be zero the loop will terminate
